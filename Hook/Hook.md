# Introducing Hooks

* Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we‚Äôve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you‚Äôre learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.
* With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

* Hooks make React so much better because you have simpler code that implements similar functionalities faster and more effectively.

* We‚Äôve often had to maintain components that started out simple but grew into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects. Each lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic. For example, components might perform some data fetching in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, the same componentDidMount method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount. Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code ends up combined in a single method. This makes it too easy to introduce bugs and inconsistencies.

* In many cases it‚Äôs not possible to break these components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all over the place. It‚Äôs also difficult to test them. This is one of the reasons many people prefer to combine React with a separate state management library. However, that often introduces too much abstraction, requires you to jump between different files, and makes reusing components more difficult
To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into managing the component‚Äôs local state with a reducer to make it more predictable.

* üìå State Hook

- This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments the value:

---
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
---

Here, useState is a Hook (we‚Äôll talk about what this means in a moment). We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It‚Äôs similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn‚Äôt merge the old and new state together. (We‚Äôll show an example comparing useState to this.state in Using the State Hook.)

* Declaring multiple state variables
You can use the State Hook more than once in a single component:
---
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
  // ...
}
---

* ‚ö°Ô∏è Effect Hook
- You‚Äôve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. We call these operations ‚Äúside effects‚Äù (or ‚Äúeffects‚Äù for short) because they can affect other components and can‚Äôt be done during rendering.

- The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API. (We‚Äôll show examples comparing useEffect to these methods in Using the Effect Hook.)

* For example, this component sets the document title after React updates the DOM:
---
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
---

- When you call useEffect, you‚Äôre telling React to run your ‚Äúeffect‚Äù function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render ‚Äî including the first render.
- Effects may also optionally specify how to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù after them by returning a function


* ‚úåÔ∏è Rules of Hooks
- Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

1. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. 

# Using the State Hook

* Equivalent Class Example
* If you used classes in React before, this code should look familiar:
---
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
---
- The state starts as { count: 0 }, and we increment state.count when the user clicks a button by calling this.setState(). We‚Äôll use snippets from this class throughout the page.

* Hooks and Function Components
- As a reminder, function components in React look like this:
---
const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}
---
* Hooks don‚Äôt work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes.
* What is a Hook? 
- Hook is a special function that lets you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features.

* When would I use a Hook?
- If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

* Declaring a State Variable
- In a class, we initialize the count state to 0 by setting this.state to { count: 0 } in the constructor:

---
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
---
- In a function component, we have no this, so we can‚Äôt assign or read this.state. Instead, we call the useState Hook directly inside our component:
---
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
---
* What does calling useState do?
- It declares a ‚Äústate variable‚Äù. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù some values between the function calls ‚Äî useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

* What do we pass to useState as an argument?
- The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state. Unlike with classes, the state doesn‚Äôt have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if that‚Äôs all we need. In our example, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable. (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice.)

* What does useState return?
- It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState(). This is similar to this.state.count and this.setState in a class, except you get them in a pair.
* Reading State
- When we want to display the current count in a class, we read this.state.count:

<p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>


- In a function, we can use count directly:


  <p>You clicked {count} times</p>


* Updating State
In a class, we need to call this.setState() to update the count state:

  <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
    Click me
  </button>
In a function, we already have setCount and count as variables so we don‚Äôt need this:

  <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    Click me
  </button>
